	<h1>Welcome to LiamG5.com!!</h1>
	
	

	<p>My name is Liam Graham and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. 
	My current interest is software development, but I'm also interested in AI(who isn't) and networking.
	 As I progress through my career I plan to add my personal projects to my github,
	  and I plan to add commentary as I work on those projects here on my <a href="notes.html">Notes</a> page.
	   You can find my Githhub on my <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page or you can go to my <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> 
	   page to go to each personal project directly.
	   </p>
	   <p></p>
	   <p> I'm glad you've found my cite! Below is photo of me, and I hope you enjoy my website!</p>
